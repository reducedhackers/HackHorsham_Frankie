The Python based Operation Game; core code


I built a large reflect game based on Operation and it uses wiring from the board to a breadboard the GPIO Pins of the Raspberry Pi. Its a simple Push button to begin and then the counter counts down on the player. If they get everything out before the end then they win; otherwise if they touch an edge or the time runs out they loose. It resets for a 1 minute game and it can fall over if you press the start button as the game plays. but that being said Its pretty much a 1.0 hack for an event and the code has robust enough to survive a few hundred games. 

I have to thank thanks to https://learn.adafruit.com/pi-video-output-using-pygame/pointing-pygame-to-the-framebuffer for pyscope  for the code for the frame buffer to handle the console out and theres plenty more I feel we could do with this game ( probably make it smaller for one thing ) 

You can see photos of the game over on my Google+ Photos Library . https://goo.gl/photos/zs9v22fa6pLZTHQMA
